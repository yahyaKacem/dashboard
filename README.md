# Dashboard Skeleton

Like Xymon, but JS-ified, modern, and pretty.  Angular on the frontend, Express on the backend, socket.io for the transport, and mysql (the node lib and RDBMS) for persistent store.

Uses:
* NodeJS
* AngularJS
* ExpressJS
* Underscore
* socket.io
* mysql (baked in ecosystem... don't ask)
